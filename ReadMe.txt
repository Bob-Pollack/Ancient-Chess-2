the program that is most complete is the Chess2Final.html site.

This is a project that a friend and I worked on back in 2011.  At the time, neither of us had any knowledge of any web languages or databases.  
The project came to an end because of our lack of database knowledge, and if we were to restart this we'd do MANY things differently.

This does not enforce the rules of the game, but does track moves and give the users a variety of ways to "fix" things by simply moving pieces and deleting moves.  
Due to an issue with the canvas, you have to click once on it for the pieces to show up.

If we were to resume work on this four+ year old project, we'd most likely start over to build something feasable from the ground up, rather than a gigantic HTML file.
