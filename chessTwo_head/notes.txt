chess 2 setup

boardarray[x][y]
have it be from 0 to 9
if anything has an x or y of 0 or of 9, something is wrong
each[x] and [y] of 1-8 represent a square on the board
value of each determines what's there

0 - empty square
1 - white classic pawn
2 - white classic knight
3 - white classic bishop
4 - white classic rook
5 - white classic queen
6 - white classic king
7 - black classic pawn
8 - black classic knight
9 - black classic bishop
10 - black classic rook
11 - black classic queen
12 - black classic king
13 - white nemesis pawn 
etc.

need 12 options for each army (for both colors)

have a draw board function to redraw the board from scratch
a) draw the white and black squares
b) use the board position to determine what is on each square and draw those piece images

Percent complete: 4% (see screenshot below)

Milestones:
Made ground-breaking graphics for all pieces
Clicking highlights the square clicked
Built a beard to store every piece's position
Added temporary space for name setup
Got board updating working: drawBoard() and updateBoard()
Made pieces moveable; solved the GOD PIECE SYNDROME

Top action items:

1. Detect captures to allow for dueling
2. Look at liq3's code for reference
3. Keep track of pieces that were captured, so that they can be put back if redo happens
3. Implement pawn promotion
4. Specify UI -- complete UI specs
5. Implement multiple connections
6. Rules implementation notes -- x295874 has been working on this; ongoing

9. Still have to read http://www.webreference.com/programm...ipt/javachess/. It looks like a promising resource.
10. Implement piece rules


Getting to 5%: Implement yomi dueling
Getting to 10%: Classic vs classic version of the game works on single computer (with dueling)
Getting to 20%: Two players on different clients can both modify the board
Getting to 25%: Make sure alternating turns works properly
Getting to 27%: Make sure alternating turns works properly, with undo button
Getting to 30%: Add the rest of the armies
Getting to 40%: Make additional components of the board (buttons, move list, history, etc...)
Getting to 80%: Pieces follow rules
