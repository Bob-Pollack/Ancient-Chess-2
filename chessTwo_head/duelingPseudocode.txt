check for the case of whitebid = 0 and blackbid = 0 and trigger a statesixskip flag if this is not the case

compare whitebid and blackbid, and determine whether the duel starter bid more than the dueled piece

[color] started the duel

[color] [did or did not] pay a stone to start the duel

white bid [whitebid]

black bid [blackbid]

[duel starter] [did or did not] bid more stones than [duel defender], so the defending piece [stays or is removed] 

decrease whitestonecount by whitebid
